# Enforce that all new commits are signed off according to the DCO,
# per CONTRIBUTING.md. Prior commits are either pre-fork, are signed off,
# or were made by Mark Thebridge, who hereby certifies the DCO with regard
# to each such commit.
#
# We then build all the code, then test it.
#
# Tests must be run on a single thread since they share keyspaces and tables.
